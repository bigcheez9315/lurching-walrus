This repository contains various programs on the kaggle data set the titanic. 
In each program, I created a training set and a test set. The training set contains all of the columns, such as pclass, sex, sibsp, parch, fare, age, ticket, cabin, embarked, passengerID, and most importantly, survived(0=no, 1 = yes). The test set has all columns except for survived. The goal is ideally to write a program that can predict whether the passenger survived if given the data from the other columns. Realistically, the goal is to just get as high a percentage correct as possible. In the different titanic files, I performed different techniques and scored different results when it came to the percentage marked right. The code is predomantly gotten from trevor stevens blog.
